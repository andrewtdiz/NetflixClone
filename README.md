# Protenus UI Coding Challenge

## Problem
For this challenge, I created a Netflix-style movie queue. The hard requirements are simply 
1) **present a list of movies in a catalog** 
2) **allow the user to manage their personal queue by adding, removing, and re-ordering the movies.**

Beyond that I was free to add to the application as I saw fit.

## Setup

This repository is essentially a bootstrapped [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) project with some slight modifications, including the addition of the TailwindCSS library. To get started you will want to:

1. Install with ```yarn```
1. Start up the application by executing ```yarn start``` from within the ui-code-challenge directory
1. The application should be accessible in your browser via ```http://localhost:3000```

That's it! From this point on you can go wild with repository.
